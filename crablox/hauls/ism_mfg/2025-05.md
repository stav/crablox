### Key Industry Comments:

Electrical Equipment: "The administration's tariffs alone have created supply chain disruptions making that of COVID-19s' [Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components] ... Tariff uncertainty is impacting new international orders."

Fabricated Metal: "There is continued uncertainty regarding market reaction to the recently imposed tariffs and resulting actions by other countries. The rare earth materials being imposed are of high concern in the near term."

Computer & Electronics: "Government spending cuts or delays, as well as tariffs, are raising hell with businesses. No one is willing to take on inventory risk."

Food & Beverage: "There is continued softening of demand in the commercial vehicle market, primarily related to higher prices and economic uncertainty. The impact of ever-changing trade policies of the current administration has wreaked havoc on suppliers' ability to react and remain profitable."

### Trading Implications:

The big story here is inventories flipping from expansion to contraction (-4.1 points) - a massive shift that suggests companies were building stock ahead of tariffs but are now pulling back hard.

New export orders continue their brutal slide, now at 40.1 and accelerating lower, while imports cratered by 7.2 points to 39.9.

The supplier deliveries index hitting 56.1 shows ports are still jammed up, but prices growth is finally starting to ease slightly even though it remains elevated.

Bottom Line: Manufacturing is caught in a perfect storm of trade uncertainty, inventory destocking, and supply chain chaos. The Trump administration's volatile trade policies are creating exactly the kind of business planning nightmare that kills forward guidance, capex and hiring decisions.
