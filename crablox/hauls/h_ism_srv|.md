### ISM Services: March 2025 Shows Concerning Slowdown

The March ISM Non-Manufacturing data dropped, and unlike February's surprising strength, we're seeing a notable pullback while still remaining in expansion territory barely. The headline PMI fell to 50.8 from 53.5 in February, marking a 2.7 point decline.

#### The Key Numbers

- **Services PMI**                   <br> 50.8 vs 53.5 (- 2.7) → Growing Slower
- **Business Activity/ Production**  <br> 55.9 vs 54.4 (+ 1.5) → Growing Faster
- **New Orders**                     <br> 50.4 vs 52.2 (- 1.8) → Growing Slower
- **Employment**                     <br> 46.2 vs 53.9 (- 7.7) → Contracting From Growing
- **Prices**                         <br> 60.9 vs 62.6 (- 1.7) → Increasing Slower
- **Supplier Deliveries**            <br> 50.6 vs 53.4 (- 2.8) → Slowing Slower
- **Inventories**                    <br> 50.3 vs 50.6 (- 0.3) → Growing Slower
- **Backlog of Orders**              <br> 47.4 vs 51.7 (- 4.3) → Contracting From Growing
- **New Export Orders**              <br> 45.8 vs 52.1 (- 6.3) → Contracting From Growing
- **Imports**                        <br> 52.6 vs 49.6 (+ 3.0) → Growing From Contracting
- **Inventory Sentiment**            <br> 56.6 vs 54.7 (+ 1.9) → Too High Faster

Three critical components (employment, backlog of orders, and new export orders) have shifted from expansion to contraction. The employment component's 7.7-point plunge is especially concerning.

### Industry Comments

#### 🍽️ Accommodation & Food Services:
"Restaurant sales and traffic have improved in the past month overall. Valentine's Day typically imparts an improved seasonal trend that was consistent this year. We remain optimistic about the coming months, despite recent news of possible recession and tariffs that have not played out yet."
#### 🚚 Transportation & Warehousing:
"We are still holding back some money for emergency use in case the new administration targets grant usage and puts a hold on current spending."
#### 💰 Finance & Insurance:
Maintaining strong growth with a level score of 8, showing resilience amid economic uncertainty.
#### 🏬 Wholesale Trade:
"Tariff confusion and the variety of ways that suppliers are responding have had a strong effect on our purchasing decisions this month, causing us to shift spend and in some cases buy in advance of reported tariffs."
#### 🏛️ Public Administration:
"Government budget cuts and layoffs are negatively impacting our operations."
#### ⚡ Utilities:
"We're expecting price increases in the near future due to tariffs on several commodity-based contracts, including waterworks items."
#### 🏗️ Construction:
"Starting to see effect of aluminum tariff. These costs will be passed on to customers."
#### 💻 Information (Contracting):
"The tariffs have caused issues in the groundwood paper market especially. With a large amount of groundwood imported from Canada to the U.S., the tariffs and resulting delays have caused havoc with the supply chain and deliveries. U.S. mills are getting backlogged and late from the additional tonnage they've taken on."
#### 🏥 Health Care & Social Assistance (Contracting):
"Patient volumes continue to exceed forecasts, leading to increased revenues and an improved financial outlook. Supply chains continue to operate efficiently and few categories — including IV solutions — are showing signs of duress. Labor outlook is improving, with reliance on travel staff continuing to recede. Outlook for the duration of the quarter is favorable."
#### 🧪 Professional, Scientific & Technical Services (Contracting):
"We are seeing some loosening in the U.S. economy related to hiring and people retention. Quality candidates are available, and employee turnover is decreasing. Competitive pressure for goods and services is increasing as suppliers seek organic increases in revenue."

### Trading Implications

The services sector is losing momentum while showing clear divergences:

- Overall PMI barely hanging onto expansion (50.8) while manufacturing data remains challenged
- Employment component's dramatic 7.7-point drop signals potential labor market cooling
- Consumer-facing sectors (accommodation, food, retail) resilient despite broader slowdown
- Prices remain elevated at 60.9 despite slowing, maintaining inflation pressure

#### The key narrative shift:

February's "surprise strength" has reversed to "concerning slowdown" with multiple components flipping to contraction. This is less about whether or not the ISMs suffuring increases recession probability.

The main driver of tailrisk here is inflation going higher during slowdown, we can see here the prices in both ISMs are pointing towards a higher CPI this year. This in contrast with recession-low consumer sentiment is painting a picture of further drawdowns in market valuations.

The business activity component's strength (+1.5 to 55.9) amidst employment contraction suggests businesses are pursuing efficiency and productivity over expansion.

#### For macro positioning:

- The services-manufacturing divergence is narrowing as services cool
- Multiple sectors citing tariff concerns with tangible supply chain impacts
- Companies with domestic value chains will be affected less and could benefit from tariffs
- Consumer resilience remains but may be tested as employment conditions weaken
- Multi-month trend of expanding backlogs has reversed, suggesting demand pressures are easing

What's your take on the tariff impact across different sectors? What are clues you see for longs and shorts?
