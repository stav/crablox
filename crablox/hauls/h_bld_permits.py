            1.499M units, smashing expectations of 1.32M. Biggest print since March 2021.
            The real story is in the details. Multi-family units exploded 58.9% to 418k while single-family barely moved (+3.3%).
            Northeast is absolutely ripping at +40.2% while the West actually cooled off (-0.7%), the Midwest (20% to 204,000), and the South (17.7% to 853,000).
            One the surface, it may look like commercial real estate players are betting big on multi-family. The reality is those guys just want to lock in rates now in fear rates will stay higher for longer or possibly go back up.
            While single-family construction won't budge for the most part until Powell lowers rates more.
