## United States Building Permits
MONTHLY NEW RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION, MARCH 2025
### 🏠 Housing: Barely Hanging On
#### Released 17 April 2025
March building permits up just 0.5% (below estimates of 1.6%).

First increase after 3 straight monthly drops, but existing home sales still falling. That slight pullback in mortgage rates didn't do much. 📉

Looking at that long-term chart - we're nowhere near recovered from the 2021 peak. Housing market remains stuck. 🧱
