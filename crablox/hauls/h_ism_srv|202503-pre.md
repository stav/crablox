# 50.8

## ISM Services PMI

for March 2025

### Macro Tailrisks & Sector Rotation

The 54% tariffs on China and EU 20% are in play now, however these are still negotiable at this point.
Against the backdrop, we have other major macro headwinds in the leading indicators.

Services PMI just came out below 50 today (updating the heatmaps later today), now both services and manufacturing are in contraction.

At the forefront has been the Consumer Sentiment report. Being in the range of 55-70 in the last few months which is in bearish territory.

Looking at the labor market, it's likely to reflect the contracting employment figures in the ISM's.

The Fed still needs inflation to go down to 2%. This the contraction in GDP they've been looking for before considering cutting rates so soon.

#### SECTOR ROTATION

With that in mind, we should be considering reducing our exposure to cyclical sectors and diversifying into defensives. I'll talk about this more in tonight's meeting.

If leading-coincident indicators continue to flash in bearish territory, they'll have the perfect storm for a couple of 25 bps rate cuts in Q2-Q3.
