## US LEI for March 2025
The Conference Board's U.S. Leading Economic Index (LEI) is a monthly composite of ten economic indicators designed to forecast short-term economic trends and signal turning points in the business cycle. It typically anticipates shifts in economic activity about seven months in advance.

### 📉 March 2025 Highlights:
- **LEI declined by 0.7%** to 100.5 (2016=100), following a 0.2% drop in February.
- **Six-month decrease** of 1.2%, indicating a continued downward trend.
- **Key contributors to the decline**:
  - **Consumer expectations** weakened.
  - **Stock prices** experienced their largest monthly drop since September 2022.
  - **New manufacturing orders** softened amid tariff-related uncertainties.

### 🧭 Interpretation
While the LEI's decline suggests slowing economic momentum, it does not currently indicate an imminent recession.

However, The Conference Board has revised its U.S. GDP growth forecast for 2025 down to 1.6%, citing concerns over trade tensions, potential inflation, and supply chain disruption.
