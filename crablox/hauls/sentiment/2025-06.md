# ðŸš¨ Consumer Sentiment: Dead Cat Bounce or Real Recovery?

Headline Number: 60.5

Michigan Consumer Sentiment jumped from 52.2, beating expectations of 53.5. First increase in six months.

The Political Split ðŸŽª

- Republicans: 98.8
- Democrats: 33.4
- Independents: 50.2

That's a 65-point partisan gap. This isn't just economics - it's politics driving sentiment.

### Inflation Expectations: The Hidden Story ðŸ“‰

Year-ahead dropped to 5.1% from 6.6%. But here's what matters: Michigan's special May inflation expections report shows we just came off three months where long-run expectations exceeded 2022 peaks - despite lower actual inflation.

The share expecting "tail inflation" (15%+) hit mid-2022 levels when inflation was running much hotter. Policy uncertainty is driving this.

Still 20% below December's post-election high of 74.0. Employment internals cracking, tariff worries persist. This feels more like relief from oversold levels than a real turn.
