# 49.0

## Manufacturing ISM Update: March 2025

1st April 2025

### 🔑 Headline: 49.0 (down from 50.3 in February)

📈 Direction: Contracting

The March Manufacturing report just landed, and we're seeing a significant shift from February's data. Just updated the Indicator Dashboard. The headline PMI has dropped below the growth threshold to 49.0 (down from 50.3), indicating contraction for the first time in recent months.

### Key Metrics:

- **Manufacturing PMI**   : 49.0 vs 50.3 (-1.3) → Now contracting
- **New Orders**          : 45.2 vs 48.6 (-3.4) → Contracting, faster rate
- **Production**          : 48.3 vs 50.7 (-2.4) → Flipped from growth to contraction
- **Employment**          : 44.7 vs 47.6 (-2.9) → Contracting, faster rate
- **Prices**              : 69.4 vs 62.4 (+7.0) → Sharply higher
- **Supplier Deliveries** : 53.5 vs 54.5 (-1.0) → Slowing, but at a slower rate
- **Inventories**         : 53.4 vs 49.9 (+3.5) → Flipped from contraction to growth
- **Backlog of Orders**   : 44.5 vs 46.8 (-2.3) → Contracting, faster rate

The price pressures continue to mount with a dramatic 7-point jump in the price index to 69.4, representing a 6-month uptrend. Meanwhile, inventories have jumped into growth territory, potentially indicating stockpiling ahead of expected tariff impacts.

#### Notable Industry Shifts

Textile Mills made a dramatic reversal from February's -4 contraction to March's +9 growth - the strongest performance in the sector.

Petroleum & Coal Products commented: "Worldwide economic instability has really begun to impact our oil and gas business. Aside from the change in the U.S. administration, the economies of China, India and Europe are drivers in what we believe is the next cyclical trough."

Meanwhile, Wood Products plummeted from +7 growth to -7 contraction, the most severe drop among all industries.

### Trading Implications

We're seeing substantial divergence in industry performance:

- Energy sectors continue showing resilience despite macro concerns
- Consumer-facing industries (Food, Beverage & Tobacco) are slipping into contraction
- Price pressures continue to accelerate at a concerning pace

The tariff theme is pervasive across industries. Fabricated Metal Products noted: "New order levels have increased and are better than expected. We suspect that our customers are trying to build inventory at current prices to get ahead of expected tariff and related cost increases."

Chemical Products observed: "Complex markets saw a surge in volume buying in anticipation of 2025 being slightly better than 2024. In March, however, all markets saw a slowdown, with fear and inventory stocking to hold through a potential crisis."

With headline manufacturing now contracting and prices surging even faster, the Fed's policy dilemma intensifies. Rate cuts may be increasingly difficult to justify despite overall economic growth beginning to slow.
