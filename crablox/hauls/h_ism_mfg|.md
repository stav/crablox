In April 2025, U.S. manufacturing contracted, with the ISM Manufacturing PMI falling to 48.7%, down from 49.0% in March. A reading below 50% indicates contraction.

**Key Highlights:**

* **New Orders:** Contracted for the third straight month, registering 47.2%, though slightly improved from March's 45.2%.

* **Production:** Dropped sharply to 44.0%, the lowest since May 2020, signaling significant weakness in output.

* **Employment:** Rose to 46.5% from 44.7%, but remained in contraction, indicating ongoing job reductions.

* **Supplier Deliveries:** Slowed further, with the index at 55.2%, suggesting continued supply chain delays.

* **Inventories:** Increased to 50.8%, reflecting potential stockpiling ahead of anticipated tariffs.

* **Prices:** Continued to rise, reaching 69.8%, the highest since June 2022, driven by tariff-related cost pressures.

* **Exports and Imports:** Both contracted; new export orders fell to 43.1%, and imports declined to 47.1%, indicating reduced international trade activity.

Overall, the manufacturing sector faced declining demand, production challenges, and inflationary pressures, largely attributed to recent tariff implementations and global trade disruptions.
