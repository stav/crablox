#### Key Industry Comments:

Public Administration: "The projects are slowly starting to be issued, albeit with a great deal of market uncertainty."

Mining: "Due to the tariffs, we've had small price increases on our international raw materials, and some suppliers are holding back inventory to cover uncertainties."

Information: "Tariffs remain a challenge, as it is not clear what duties apply. The best plan is still to delay decisions to purchase where possible."

Health Care: "Federal budget cuts are affecting purchasing decisions."

Professional Services: "Life science startups continue to push forward on clinical trials and market launches. The level of investment grew this month."

Transportation & Warehousing: "Tariff variability has thrown residential construction supply chains into chaos. Many items are still manufactured in southeast Asia, and suppliers are beginning to test the waters for increases."

### Trading Implications

New orders collapsed 5.9 points while prices spiked 3.6 points to their highest level since November 2022.

The quote from ISM's Steve Miller says it all: "Respondents continued to report difficulty in forecasting and planning due to longer-term tariff uncertainty and frequently cited efforts to delay or minimize ordering until impacts become clearer."

#### The sector rotation is telling:

Finance & Insurance, Retail Trade, and Transportation all contracting while government-adjacent sectors like Public Administration and Educational Services are growing.

#### Bottom Line: 

Services just joined Manufacturing in contraction territory. When 80% of the economy starts pulling back due to policy uncertainty, that's a macro headwind you can't ignore.
