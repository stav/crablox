#### Sentiment Drags to Multi-Year Lows

### Preliminary Results for March 2025

Just got the latest Michigan numbers and they crashed to 57.0 in March, the lowest we've seen since November 2022. This is way below the 63.1 forecast and marks the third straight monthly decline.

Current conditions fell to 53.5 from 65.7, while expectations dropped to 54.2 from 64.0.

What's particularly concerning is the inflation outlook - year-ahead expectations shot up to 4.9% (highest since late 2022) and the five-year gauge jumped to 3.9%, marking the largest monthly increase since 1993.

The political divide continues to widen dramatically.

Democratic sentiment has absolutely collapsed to 41.4 in March from 51.3 in February, while Republican sentiment held relatively steady at 83.9. Independents are sliding too, down to 57.2.

This sentiment crash has real trading implications. We're approaching levels typically seen during recessions, and the combination of deteriorating expectations with rising inflation fears screams stagflation. The Fed is in a tough spot with these inflation expectations - rate cuts might be off the table longer than markets expect.

ðŸ’° TRADING IMPLICATIONS

This adds another layer of context and creativity for both shorts and longs. If liberal consumers are spending the least, this is another tailrisk for companies who have built a brand around this demographic. Think about which names in retail, consumer discretionary, and even tech for example might be exposed to this demographic spending pullback. The reverse for longs.
