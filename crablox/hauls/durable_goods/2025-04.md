## United States Durable Goods Orders

### New Orders Excluding Transportation

> New orders for manufactured durable goods in April, down following four consecutive monthly increases, decreased $19.9 billion or 6.3 percent to $296.3 billion, the U.S. Census Bureau announced today. This followed a 7.6 percent March increase. Excluding transportation, new orders increased 0.2 percent. Excluding defense, new orders decreased 7.5 percent. Transportation equipment, also down following four consecutive monthly increases, drove the decrease, $20.3 billion or 17.1 percent to $98.8 billion. 

The damage:

* Total orders down 6.3% ðŸ“‰
* Ex-transportation actually up 0.2% ðŸ¤”

Transportation got absolutely destroyed (-17.1%) because Boeing basically had no orders (8 total ðŸ˜†). Airlines scared of tariffs = no plane buying.

The real issue though: Capital goods down 14.6% again. That's businesses not investing in equipment/growth. Way more concerning than the volatile plane action.

1 out of 3 key indicators showing weakness. I would prefer to see some more confirmation in the others before leaping to a hard conclusion of continued negative GDP QoQ for Q2.
