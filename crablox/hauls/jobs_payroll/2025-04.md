### Employment Situation Report
United States Non-Farm Payrolls for April 2025
#### Released 2 May 2025

The April jobs report just dropped, and it's throwing a wrench in the Fed's rate-cut calculus we discussed in last night's meeting. The economy added 177,000 jobs in April, significantly beating market expectations of 130,000.

##### The Key Numbers:

- Total Jobs Added: 177,000 vs 185,000 in March (downwardly revised)
- Market Expectations: 130,000 (beaten by 47,000 jobs)
- 12-Month Average: 152,000 jobs per month

##### Sector Breakdown:
- 🏥 Health Care: +51,000 (leading the pack)
- 🚚 Transportation & Warehousing: +29,000
- 💰 Financial Activities: +14,000
- 🤝 Social Assistance: +8,000
- 🏛️ Federal Government: -9,000 (notable decline)

##### Trading Implications: 
Remember our discussion last night (May 1st)? This stronger-than-expected jobs report complicates the Fed's calculus on rate cuts. With the labor market showing resilience despite tariff concerns, the Fed has less justification for the four cuts markets were pricing in.

###### Next Rate Cut Catalyst: 
All eyes now turn to the Services ISM printing Monday, and upcoming inflation print. If the Consumer Price Index shows continued strength, the Fed will face a difficult stagflation-like scenario: This could force them to prioritize inflation fighting over growth concerns.
As I mentioned in our meeting, this payroll beat pushes the Fed further from the multiple cuts scenario. The market will likely need to adjust expectations, which could create volatility in rate-sensitive sectors.

### Revision
_On June 6th, 2025 revisions were made._

The change in total nonfarm payroll employment for April was revised down by 30,000, from +177,000 to
+147,000.
