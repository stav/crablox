# 139 K
### Employment Situation Report
United States Non-Farm Payrolls for May 2025
#### Released 6 June 2025

Nonfarm payrolls hit 139K for May - beat the 130K expectation but down from April's revised 147K.

Sub-100K nonfarm is one of the last dominoes before the Fed gets serious about cutting rates. As long as jobs hold up here, Powell's got cover to stay hawkish ðŸ¦…

#### The breakdown:

- Healthcare +62K (hospitals leading)
- Leisure/hospitality +48K
- Manufacturing -8K (watch this space)
- Federal gov -22K (down 59K since January)

But here's the kicker - **March/April got revised DOWN by 95K combined. That's not small potatoes.**

My take: Labor market is slowing but not breaking... yet.

Those ISM employment readings have been contracting for months. Eventually that shows up in the headline numbers. When it does, and we crack below 100K consistently, that's when things get interesting ðŸŽ¯

Trump policy changes could accelerate this timeline. Keep watching.

The setup is building. Just not there yet ðŸ‘€

I'm considering shorting Manpower (MAN) an employment agency.

### Revision
_On June 6th, 2025 revisions were made._

The change in total nonfarm payroll employment for March was revised down by 65,000, from
+185,000 to +120,000, and the change for April was revised down by 30,000, from +177,000 to
+147,000. With these revisions, employment in March and April combined is 95,000 lower than
previously reported. (Monthly revisions result from additional reports received from
businesses and government agencies since the last published estimates and from the
recalculation of seasonal factors.)
