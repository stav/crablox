##### NonFarm Payrolls - Good but Bad
NFP Dec: 256K vs 160K exp (Nov revised to 212K)

- Healthcare +46K
- Retail +43K
- Gov't +33K
- Manufacturing -13K

##### Key points: Huge beat - not even close to estimates.

Nov got revised down but doesn't matter, labor market's still cooking. Retail bounced back hard after that weak Nov.

2024 avg monthly gains = 186K vs 251K in 2023.

Bottom line: Labor market refuses to break. Add in today's hot Michigan inflation expectations and the Fed's got zero reason to cut.

Rates staying higher for even longer.
