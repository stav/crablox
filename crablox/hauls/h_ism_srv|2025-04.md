# 51.6

## ISM Services PMI
### Shows Mixed Recovery
for April 2025

The April ISM Non-Manufacturing data has arrived, showing a modest rebound from March's concerning slowdown. The headline PMI increased to 51.6 from 50.8 in March, marking a 0.8 point improvement and beating market expectations of 50.6.

#### The Key Numbers
- **Services PMI**                   <br> 51.6 vs 50.8 (+ 0.8) → Growing Faster
- **Business Activity/ Production**  <br> 53.7 vs 55.9 (- 2.2) → Growing Slower
- **New Orders**                     <br> 52.3 vs 50.4 (+ 1.9) → Growing Faster
- **Employment**                     <br> 49.0 vs 46.2 (+ 2.8) → Contracting Slower
- **Supplier Deliveries**            <br> 51.3 vs 50.6 (+ 0.7) → Slowing Faster
- **Inventories**                    <br> 53.4 vs 50.3 (+ 3.1) → Growing Faster
- **Prices**                         <br> 65.1 vs 60.9 (+ 4.2) → Increasing Faster
- **Backlog of Orders**              <br> 48.0 vs 47.4 (+ 0.6) → Contracting Slower
- **New Export Orders**              <br> 48.6 vs 45.8 (+ 2.8) → Contracting Slower
- **Imports**                        <br> 44.3 vs 52.6 (- 8.3) → Contracting From Growing
- **Inventory Sentiment**            <br> 56.1 vs 56.6 (- 0.5) → Too High Slower

The headline PMI has recovered somewhat, but beneath the surface we're seeing significant divergence. While new orders and inventories grew faster, the sharp 4.2-point jump in the prices component to 65.1 (highest since February 2023) signals intensifying inflation pressures. Employment remains in contraction territory despite some improvement.

### Industry Comments

🍽️ Accommodation & Food Services: "Sales and traffic have improved on track with year-over-year seasonal trends. We seem to be outperforming some of the publicly traded restaurants reporting results."

🏬 Wholesale Trade: Strong performance with level score of 10, continuing the solid momentum from previous months.

🏠 Real Estate, Rental & Leasing: "Uncertainty remains the dominating theme as the U.S. government has been maddeningly inconsistent with tariff implementation."

🏥 Health Care & Social Assistance: "We are actively reviewing the impact of tariffs. We are seeing some vendors increasing their prices, and we are actively pushing back on those increases. We expect our vendors to honor our contracted pricing."

🚚 Transportation & Warehousing: "Tariffs and concerns about government grants still impacting our procurement operations. Some projects are slowing or being held off to ensure we have funds to complete the current work."

🎓 Educational Services: "There is great concern at my institution (medical school with a research institute and hospital) that changes from the current administration will severely and adversely affect many of the populations we are trying to help live healthier lives."

⚡ Utilities: "The tariff uncertainty is causing a lot of consumption of human capital. We are starting to see some tariff charges, some are significant given the price of the highly specialized units that were ordered over two years ago. Based on our spend over the last couple of years, we will have to adjust our capital and operations and maintenance plans."

🏗️ Construction (Contracting): "Business is steady."

🏛️ Public Administration (Contracting): "Our business is in a state of crises with uncertainty caused by both the ongoing trade war and the threats to federal funding of programs."

🌾 Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing & Hunting (Contracting): "Tariffs are negatively impacting small business customers. Many small business customers source their products from China. They cannot afford to compete in the marketplace sourcing from other countries. We could not move products fast enough to beat the tariff starting dates."

### Trading Implications

The services sector presents a complex picture in April:

- Headline PMI modestly recovering (51.6) while still near expansion/contraction border
- Striking 4.2-point jump in prices component (65.1) suggests sustained inflation pressures
- Employment still contracting despite improvement, signaling ongoing labor market adjustment
- Significant sector rotation with Finance & Insurance now contracting, while Mining has rebounded

#### The key narrative shift:

March's "concerning slowdown" has evolved into "mixed recovery with persistent inflation." The divergence between strengthening price pressures (65.1, highest since Feb 2023) and still-contracting employment presents a challenging scenario for monetary policy.

What's particularly noteworthy is the sector rotation we're seeing in the six-month trend. Previously strong sectors like Finance & Insurance have flipped to contraction, while sectors like Mining have shown remarkable resilience after prior weakness.

#### For macro positioning:

- Tariff impacts are no longer just concerns but are manifesting in actual price increases across sectors
- Government budget constraints continue to weigh on public administration and related sectors
- Consumer-facing industries remain surprisingly resilient despite broader economic uncertainty
- Imports have contracted sharply (-8.3), suggesting potential supply chain disruptions ahead

The historical context shows we're in a precarious position – while not yet approaching recessionary territory on the headline number, the combination of still-weak Manufacturing PMI & Consumer Sentiment, and in this report accelerating price pressures creates a challenging environment for Q2 GDP growth.
